Problem Statement
-----------------
1.Fetch date and temperature from temperature_data where zip code is greater than
  300000 and less than 399999.
2.Calculate maximum temperature corresponding to every year from temperature_data
  table.
3.Calculate maximum temperature from temperature_data table corresponding to those
  years which have at least 2 entries in the table.
4.Create a view on the top of last query, name it temperature_data_vw.
5.Export contents from temperature_data_vw to a file in local file system, such that each
  file is '|' delimited.

Solution
--------
1.select date,temperature from temperature_data where zipcode> 300000 and zipcode < 399999;
2.select year(date), max(temperature) from temperature_data group by year(date); 
3.select year(date), count (*),max(temperature) from temperature_data group by year(date) having count(date) =2;
4.create view temperature_data_vw as select year(date), count (*),max(temperature) from temperature_data group by year(date) having count(date) =2;
5.insert overwrite local directory '/tmp/assignment14_2' row format delimited fields terminated by '|' select * from temperature_data_vw;
